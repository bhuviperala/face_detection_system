# 🧠 Face Detection & Logging System

A Python-based real-time face recognition system that:
- Detects known faces using webcam
- Saves the full frame image with timestamp
- Logs detections into a CSV file
- Plays a sound alert on successful detection
- Automatically exits after first successful detection

## 📸 How to Use

1. Place images of known people in `known_faces/` folder.
   ✅ Filenames should be: `name.jpg`

2. Make sure `assets/detected.mp3` sound file exists (or change filename in code).

3. Run the app:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Once a known face is detected:

   * Full image is saved to `logs/images/`
   * Entry is written to `logs/detections.csv`
   * Sound is played
   * Program exits automatically
